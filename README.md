## Overview

This repository's purpose is to document my journey of practicing [USACO](usaco.org) problems and completing in contests. 

The repository is structured into divisions, which is further divided into different difficulties of problems. There will also be a `contest` folder that contains the solutions to previous contests that I've participated in, although they will likely be post-contest upsolves. 

Each problem folder contains the source file for the problem, and each source file will contain a comment header that links to the original problem website. There will not be any guarantees for the quality or speed of my solutions.
